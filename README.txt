Andrew Saydjari updated this (forked) version of Bayestar for the DECaPS dust map run from Greg M. Green's original repo. The main changes were just to make it compile with modern compilers. The src/, cmake/, and data/ directories were updated accordingly. No guarantees are made about the scripts/ and input/ directories. A more recent config-example.txt file is also included. Any questions can be directed to andrew-saydjari or gregreen.
